what is the difference between .bashrc, /etc/bash.bashrc , .profile and /etc/profile


so the main difference between them all come down two key questions.

1- Who is it for? (just you or all users on system)
2- When does it run? (when you first log in, or every time you open new terminal)


1- WHO IS IT FOR???

User Specific ==> ~/.bashrc && ~/.profile
System Wide ==> /etc/bahs.bashrc && /etc/profile

2- WHEN IS IT READ

login shell ===> /etc/profile && ~/.profile (must be you who start the login shell)

interactive (non login shell) ====> ~/.bashrc  && ~/etc/
