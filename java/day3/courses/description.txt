Project Description:

Build a console-based system where:
	•	The user can add students.
	•	Each student can register for multiple courses.
	•	The system prints reports using StringBuilder.
	•	Input for multiple courses is parsed using StringTokenizer.
	•	Use wrapper classes for IDs, grades, etc., to show autoboxing/unboxing.
	•	Use an interface for actions (e.g., registration).
	•	Use an inner class to represent each student’s course registration.



Attributes inside Student
	•	Integer studentId → The unique ID of the student (uses wrapper class).
	•	String name → The student’s full name.

ArrayList<CourseRegistration> registrations → A list that contains all courses the student is registered in.
This uses the inner class CourseRegistration.


Methods inside Student
	•	registerCourse(Course course, Double grade)
Lets the student register for a course and optionally store a grade.
Uses autoboxing with Double.
	•	psrintReport()
Prints all the courses and grades of the student.
This method should use a StringBuilder to build the formatted report.
	•	getStudentId()
Returns the student ID.
	•	getName()
Returns the student’s name.
	•	getRegistrations()
Returns the list of CourseRegistration items.




Inner Class: CourseRegistration

This class is inside Student, because it belongs only to a student.

Attributes of CourseRegistration:
	•	Course course → The course that the student took.
	•	Double grade → The student’s grade in that course.

Methods of CourseRegistration:
	•	getCourse() → Returns the course.
	•	getGrade() → Returns the grade.


2. Class: Course
Represents a course that students can register in.
Attributes inside Course
	•	﻿﻿Integer courseId → Unique ID of the course.
	•	﻿﻿String courseName → Name of the course (e.g., OOP, Databases).
	•	﻿﻿Integer creditHours → Number of credit hours.
Methods inside Course
	•	﻿﻿getCourseId() → Returns courseID.
	•	﻿﻿getCourseName () → Returns course name.
	•	﻿﻿getCreditHours () → Returns credit hours.
